# DoubanBookCrawler
Crawler based on Scrapy-redis to crawl 150 thousand book data.

In October 2020, based on this [scrapy tutorial in Chinese](https://www.yuque.com/tianyuan-89esu/aycxzr/veioml), I completed the crawling of 150,000 book data classification tags on Douban. The content includes all the data information of the book detail page and 10 comments on the long review detail page, which are stored in the mysql structured database for subsequent machine learning.
